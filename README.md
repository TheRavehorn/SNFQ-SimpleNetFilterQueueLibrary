# SNFQ - Simple NetFilterQueue Library
SNFQ is a Simple NetFilterQueue Library developed by Ravehorn.

It is built on top of NetfilterQueue (https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue) and basically is a higher-level wrapper with limited functionality but simpler usage.
It also applies linux commands necessary to manipulate the queue on a basic way, such as opening and closing iptables.

My projects using the SNFQ Library:

https://github.com/TheRavehorn/File-Interceptor<br>
https://github.com/TheRavehorn/Code-Injector (lib slightly modified to use Python 2)
